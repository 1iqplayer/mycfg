-i → case-insensitive search

-r / -R → recursive search in directories (-R follows symlinks too)

-l / -L → print only names of files with (-l) or without (-L) matches

-c → count matches instead of printing them

-v → invert match (show non-matching lines)

-o → print only the matching part of the line

-w → match whole words only

-A NUM / -B NUM / -C NUM → show context: after / before / both around matches

-E → extended regex (like egrep)
